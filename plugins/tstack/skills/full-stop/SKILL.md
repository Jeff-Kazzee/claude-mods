# Full Stop

Do the same work as `full-send`, but stop with the PR ready for the user to merge.
Never merge it.

Read [full-send](../full-send/SKILL.md) and follow its workflow, proof rules,
review, and babysitting steps. An explicit "full stop" request authorizes that
work without a separate "full send" request. That includes full-send's
testing permission. A "full stop" request is the permission for the test
methods Proof needs, even when a project file says to ask first, for
example before computer use. Use those methods directly. Its merge
permission does not apply. The overrides below take precedence.

## No merging

You may commit, push, rebase, fix conflicts, and use `--force-with-lease` on
this task's branch. Never merge, enable auto-merge, enter a merge queue, push
to the default branch, bypass branch protection, or delegate those actions.

Disable existing auto-merge and remove the PR from any merge queue before
work begins; check again before each push. Report these changes. If you
cannot prevent automatic merging, report the blocker before proceeding.

## Stop at the gate

Use full-send's merge gate as the readiness check. Replace its merge and
final report steps with a handoff. Proof and review must cover the final diff;
recheck behavior changes and meaningful conflict fixes before handoff.

Fetch the target branch and check the live PR's head, base, checks, reviews,
and mergeability. Confirm it is open, not a draft, and not set to merge
without the user. If someone else merged it, report that instead.

- **Ready to merge:** the merge gate passes. Leave the PR open and unmerged.
- **Waiting for required approval:** only human approval remains. Confirm
  that this is the actual blocker.
- **Blocked:** explain what prevents readiness, what you tried, and what is
  needed. Follow full-send's rules for asking the user.

In T3 Code, call `unwatch_pull_request` before the handoff or a question.
Report the PR link, final head, verdict, proof, reviewer outcome, and remaining
risks. State whether the PR is still open and unmerged.

## On Jeff's machine

This section is added by the jeff-mods `tstack` plugin and outranks the steps
above where they differ. The `full-send` skill's own "On Jeff's machine"
section applies here too: `agent-git claim` for the branch, `dev` as the base,
the verify skill in the proof, and Sol through the local routes.

The force-push permission above covers only a branch this agent created in this
task. On a branch another agent or person created, push without force, or move
the work to a new branch from `agent-git claim`.

At the handoff, record the receipt from a session that did not build the
change (`agent-git receipt`), then run `agent-git stage <id> "Waiting on Jeff"
"<PR link> at <sha>"`. End the report with one line Jeff can answer in five
minutes: "Merge PR <n> at <sha>?"
